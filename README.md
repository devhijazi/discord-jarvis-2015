Jarvis rebuild 2019
Hey there, i'm Hijazi owner of Jarvis your bot :).

I hereby notify all users that I have recreated the entire Jarvis system with new technologies and improvements!

As you should know, jarvis is a free project so there are no extraordinary things I can do yet !, but with my constant learning I have been modifying the jarvis codes to make their use much simpler and more efficient!

But what was happening?
R- Jarvis had a simple and ineffective programming system, so there were problems like Lagging, lack of memory and the system was constantly restarted and often the songs seemed to be stealing songs ... out of other problems. In other words, jarvis was unstable!

What has been done to improve this?
The new codes now have a system of Shards jarvis has 4 shards, this causes the use of memory to be reduced by 80% or more and latency too, stopping the problems of lagging and bot drop.

Why have all my settings been reset?
We reset the jarvis database because we made many changes there as well, ensuring more user security. The new database system has data such as ID and name of each user and each guild, all presets have been reconfigured and we added a system of bans per database, we release spaces and relieve the weight of your bank increasing the response time of each command.

I still have doubts, what should I do?
If there is any doubt contact me as soon as possible with me, I will be making my personal Discord available so that they can call me privately and ask me any questions. Discord> Hijazi#0001 Server > https://discordapp.com/invite/VxVMXYH

End
I apologize for the inconvenience but this was necessary! soon the new Help system will be available but for now all the commands remain the same! only the setprefix has been switched to prefix set.

Kind Regards- HijaZi
